### Bout me?

I'm a Software Engineer based in Pune, Maharashtra. My journey's been a wild ride through DevOps, Robotics, Industrial Warehouse Automation, and logistics. Right now, I'm coding it up at [Vanderlande](https://www.vanderlande.com/) and juggling it with my Computer Engineering degree at [ADYPSOE](https://adypsoe.in/). ðŸŽ“ðŸ’»
